Google did not only show off their recent design visions for Android on I/O yesterday, but also Project Polymer, which is their take on web components. I have a hard time making up my mind about pre-styled web components, because I really don't see the urgent need for an unified look and feel on the web. We all grew tired of Twitter Bootstrap, right?

However, it is still interesting to see their effort. Just look at these trippy tabs. _(Click to zoom)_

Interesting stuff. You don't really interact with a typical button here. It is not pressed down, or otherwise look like a button from real life. They call them _inky_, as when ink from a old-school pen seeps through paper. I think this feels relevant when you actually interact with a pointy object such as a pointer, but if I use fingers for interaction, perhaps something more "pressy" would suit better. Also, the color is out of control, no sane person would use that.
